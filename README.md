# 💻 Robson Muniz  
## React Developer for SaaS Founders — MVPs in 14 Days

I help **early-stage founders and small startups** ship **production-ready React MVPs fast**, without the usual delays, overengineering, or unreliable freelancers.

👉 From idea to a deployed app you can show users or investors — **in 14 days**.

## 🚀 What I Do (Clear & Simple)

**Productized Service:**  
### ⚡ Production-Ready React MVP — €2,500

**Included:**
- React frontend (clean, scalable architecture)
- Authentication (login / signup)
- Core product flows (up to 4 main screens)
- Responsive UI (mobile + desktop)
- Deployment (Vercel / Netlify)
- Clean, readable codebase
- 7 days post-delivery support

**Not included (on purpose):**
- Endless revisions
- Feature creep
- Unclear scope

This keeps delivery fast and predictable.

## 🎯 Who This Is For

This is a good fit if you are:
- A **non-technical founder**
- Building a **B2B SaaS or internal tool**
- Validating an idea or preparing for users/investors
- Tired of projects dragging on for months

If speed and reliability matter — we’ll work well together.

## 🧠 How I Work

- Clear scope before starting  
- Fixed price, fixed timeline  
- Frequent progress updates  
- Production mindset (not demos, not tutorials)

I use modern tools (React, TypeScript, Node.js) and AI-assisted workflows to **move fast without sacrificing quality**.
